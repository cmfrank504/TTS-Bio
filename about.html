	<h1>Chloe M Frank</h1>
	<h2>Some gal with a machine</h2>
	<p>I'm learning how to program so I can travel the world.  What do I look for in a job? Flexibility, mobility, and an environment of constant education.  I am hoping to be hired as a junior developer after a year of working at my current job and taking on tasks.  I would like to move to Austin, Colorado, or maybe California.</p>
